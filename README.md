My DIY work on Nintendo Famicom

## Controllers

### * Convert FC controllers to adapt to 9-pin RS232 socket
The original FC controller have a 5-pin(1p) or 6-pin(2p) pin head plugged into the socket on main PCB board. Unlike its successors, the FC controller can not be changed easily without opening the case.

One day a guy claimed that he had successfully designed and made a famiclone named "RGB-FC" which can output through RGBhv or VGA with splendid video quality. So I bought one.

RGB-FC provides two 9-pin controller connectors, can be used with a large number of "Subor" pads. But the pads are sucks, so I have to mod my original controllers to adapt with RGB-FC.

First, I purchased several RS232 female connectors, then cut the pin head of the controller and started to wire them together.

The wiring method is showed above. The 2p controller has an additional mic wire than the 1p's. I don't know how to wire it so I left it empty.
